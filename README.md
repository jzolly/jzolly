Hey,
Welcome to my GitHub. I am a new Software Engineer with a lifetime practice in being curious!  I am a maker, and love creating new things. Software Engineering allows me to explore skills long built working and studying in fine arts as well as math education.  I am a fullstack engineer with passions and skills in front end development. Feel free to explore my projects and and get a taste for how I approach problem solving and creating new things!


##Self-Description
Being a person who is perpetually curious, I genuinely enjoy living my life!  My core values are very community driven and tend to foster an atmosphere of acceptance and permissiveness.  Creating this growth mindset space in my life for myself and those around me has lead to learn and explore a wide variety of topics and interest.  I am a musician, a cook, an outdoor enthusiast, an artist, a gamer (both video and table top), an athlete, a lover of fantasy and sci-fi, and an academic who loves knowledge.
