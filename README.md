Hey,
Welcome to my GitHub. I see software engineering as a problem solving playground where logic can collide with creativity. Software Engineering allows me to further explore the fine art and logic skills that I honed as an artist and math teacher. I'm currently learning fullstack, and finding that I'm gravitating towards the frontend as a way to us my passion and skill in design. Feel free to explore my projects and and get a taste for how I approach problem solving and creating new things!

### Self-Description


Being a person who is perpetually curious 🔍, I genuinely enjoy living my life!  My core values are very community driven and I try to foster an atmosphere of acceptance and permissiveness wherever I go.  Creating this growth mindset space in my life for myself and those around me has lead to learn and explore a wide variety of topics and interest.  I am a musician 🎶, a cook 👩‍🍳, an outdoor enthusiast 🌳, an artist 🎨, a gamer (both video 🎮 and table top 🎲), an athlete 🥏, a lover of fantasy and sci-fi 📖, and an academic who loves knowledge 🧠.
